My name's Andi and I like food. I like reading about it, writing about it, thinking about it, but mostly I like cooking and eating it.

In mid-2015 I moved to the coast and a house with the small (but lovely) kitchen that I named my blog after. I've cooked for many years but this is the first time I've mostly been cooking small, quick, healthy food for myself. That's what this site is about.
